\section*{Introduction}

The Healthy Brain Network (HBN) is a landmark pediatric mental health study collecting MRI images and clinical assessment data from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (Alexander 2017). The HBN dataset contains a wealth of phenotypic and imaging data, including diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, which allows for analysis of the physical properties of developing white matter (Wandell 2016). This dMRI data is openly available in raw form through the Functional Connectomes Project and the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative (FCP-INDI), spurring collaboration on open big-data reproducible science (Avesani 2019). However, analysis of dMRI data must start with a pipeline of critical preprocessing steps, such as eddy current correction, motion correction, and adjustment of the gradient directions. Because of the complexity of some of these steps, investigators may neglect to perform preprocessing or may make errors that can induce bias in their subsequent interpretation of the data (Jones 2010). Furthermore, once preprocessing is done correctly and transparently once, there is little need for researchers to repeat this step. Thus, there is a need for an openly available preprocessed diffusion derivative dataset that applies best practices in preprocessing in a robust and transparent way (Cieslak 2020). Accordingly, here we introduce the HBN Preprocessed Open Diffusion Derivatives (HBN-POD2), a large dataset for the analysis of structural brain connectivity and pediatric mental health.

\section*{Results}

Outputs from each of the curation and preprocessing steps, as well as QC ratings, are openly available on FCP-INDI. Similarly, HBN-POD2 offers open QC metrics, eliminating the need for investigators to repeat quality assessment for over 2,000 scans. Using a previously developed cloud-computing library 7 to parallelize the preprocessing over individual subjects on spot instances in the Amazon Web Services Batch service, this dMRI preprocessing cost less than \textdollar1.00 per subject.

\section*{Discussion}

We present HBN-POD2, one of the largest youth diffusion imaging datasets with derived measures currently available. It is openly available and complies with the current draft of the BIDS diffusion derivative specification. It will grow continuously as the HBN study acquires more data, eventually reaching its 10,000 subject goal. The data is amenable to many different analyses, including tractometry (Yeatman 2012), graph theoretical analysis (Yeh 2020), and combinations with functional data for the same subjects. The availability of standardized preprocessed diffusion data will allow researchers to create and test hypotheses on the white matter properties underlying behavior and disease, from reading and math acquisition to childhood adversity and mental health. As such, this dataset will accelerate discovery at the nexus of structural connectivity and neurodevelopmental and learning disorders.

\section*{Methods}

We curated the imaging metadata for 2,615 of the 2,747 currently available HBN subjects. Using dcm2bids and custom scripts, we conformed the data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS; Gorgolewski 2016) specification. We then performed dMRI preprocessing on 2,136 subjects, using QSIPrep (Cieslak 2020), a robust and scalable pipeline to group, distortion correct, motion correct, denoise, coregister and resample MRI scans (see Figure 1). In total, 417 subjects failed this preprocessing step, largely due to missing dMRI files. To assess image quality, we released a citizen science web application, drawing on the success of a previous application in assessing the quality of HBN's structural MRI data (Keshavan 2019). After a brief tutorial, citizen scientists provided binary pass/fail ratings based on the directionally-colorized fractional anisotropy from DTI of each subject's preprocessed dMRI data. These citizen scientist ratings were then combined with expert ratings (see Figure 2) to train a neural network to assign a quality control (QC) rating to each subject.

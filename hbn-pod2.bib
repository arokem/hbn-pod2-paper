  abstract    = {We describe the Open Diffusion Data Derivatives (O3D)
                 repository: an integrated collection of preserved brain data
                 derivatives and processing pipelines, published together using
                 a single digital-object-identifier. The data derivatives were
                 generated using modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
                 imaging data (dMRI) with diverse properties of resolution and
                 signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to the data, we publish all
                 processing pipelines (also referred to as open cloud
                 services). The pipelines utilize modern methods for
                 neuroimaging data processing (diffusion-signal modelling,
                 fiber tracking, tractography evaluation, white matter
                 segmentation, and structural connectome construction). The O3D
                 open services can allow cognitive and clinical neuroscientists
                 to run the connectome mapping algorithms on new,
                 user-uploaded, data. Open source code implementing all O3D
                 services is also provided to allow computational and computer
                 scientists to reuse and extend the processing methods.
                 Publishing both data-derivatives and integrated processing
                 pipeline promotes practices for scientific reproducibility and
                 data upcycling by providing open access to the research assets

  abstract = {Advancements in technology over the last two decades have changed
              how spatial data are created and used. In particular, in the last
              decade, volunteered geographic information (VGI), i.e., the
              crowdsourcing of geographic information, has revolutionized the
              spatial domain by shifting the map-making process from the hands
              of experts to those of any willing contributor. Started in 2004,
              OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the pinnacle of VGI due to the large
              number of volunteers involved and the volume of spatial data
              generated. While the original objective of OSM was to create a
              free map of the world, its uses have shown how the potential of
              such an initiative goes well beyond map-making: ranging from
              projects such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT) project,
              that understands itself as a bridge between the OSM community and
              humanitarian responders, to collaborative projects such as
              Mapillary, where citizens take street-level images and the system
              aims to automate mapping. A common trend among these projects
              using OSM is the fact that the community dynamic tends to create
              spin-off projects. Currently, we see a drive towards projects
              that support sustainability goals using OSM. We discuss some such
              applications and highlight challenges posed by this new paradigm.
              We also explore the most promising future uses of this
              increasingly popular participatory phenomenon.},

  abstract    = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic
                 resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying
                 microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many
                 other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical
                 between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images
                 across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional
                 anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy
                 participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that
                 the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting
                 the need of correcting for site effects before performing
                 downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that
                 combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization,
                 may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the
                 inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization
                 approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular
                 batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best
                 at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability
                 in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of
                 interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological
                 variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by
                 site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods
                 in the presence of different levels of confounding between
                 site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample
                 size studies.},

  abstract    = {With the proliferation of multi-site neuroimaging studies,
                 there is a greater need for handling non-biological variance
                 introduced by differences in MRI scanners and acquisition
                 protocols. Such unwanted sources of variation, which we refer
                 to as ``scanner effects'', can hinder the detection of imaging
                 features associated with clinical covariates of interest and
                 cause spurious findings. In this paper, we investigate scanner
                 effects in two large multi-site studies on cortical thickness
                 measurements across a total of 11 scanners. We propose a set
                 of tools for visualizing and identifying scanner effects that
                 are generalizable to other modalities. We then propose to use
                 ComBat, a technique adopted from the genomics literature and
                 recently applied to diffusion tensor imaging data, to combine
                 and harmonize cortical thickness values across scanners. We
                 show that ComBat removes unwanted sources of scan variability
                 while simultaneously increasing the power and reproducibility
                 of subsequent statistical analyses. We also show that ComBat
                 is useful for combining imaging data with the goal of studying
                 life-span trajectories in the brain.},

  abstract    = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
                 has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
                 thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI
                 and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the
                 non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is
                 routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there
                 has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and
                 describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This
                 renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs)
                 difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the
                 application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance
                 protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain
                 Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and
                 describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats
                 compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of
                 practices already common in the field, and captures the
                 metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

                 quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic
                 tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible
                 for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian
                 behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this
                 method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such
                 as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an
                 extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that
                 requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified
                 image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion
                 coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess
                 kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability
                 distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure
                 from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult
                 subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be
                 significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter,
                 reflecting the structural differences between these two types
                 of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related
                 to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of
                 imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing
                 effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure
                 abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

                 inferences from diffusion MRI can be challenging and is
                 subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion
                 indices and eventually comparing them between groups of
                 subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts
                 at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long
                 pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is
                 susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the
                 accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors.
                 This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the
                 analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are
                 grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the
                 tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4
                 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally
                 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region
                 of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based
                 analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion
                 MRI analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and
                 eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of
                 interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We
                 have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported)
                 into a single article, which should serve as a useful
                 reference for those embarking on new diffusion MRI-based
                 studies, and as a check for those who may already be running
                 studies but may have overlooked some important confounds.
                 While some of these problems are well known to diffusion
                 experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to
                 undertake a clinical study based on diffusion MRI.},

  abstract    = {Tissue classification plays a crucial role in the
                 investigation of normal neural development, brain-behavior
                 relationships, and the disease mechanisms of many psychiatric
                 and neurological illnesses. Ensuring the accuracy of tissue
                 classification is important for quality research and, in
                 particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical
                 practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct
                 various errors inherent to all currently available
                 segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes
                 methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of
                 increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the
                 rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed
                 Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the
                 collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing
                 outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to
                 organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data,
                 an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing
                 toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is
                 flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software
                 package in any data organization structure. Example
                 configurations for three large, open-source datasets are
                 presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the
                 Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the
                 Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These
                 demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics,
                 regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging
                 viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement
                 quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and

                 discovery. However, many standard lab protocols rely on manual
                 examination, which is not feasible for large-scale datasets.
                 Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert
                 examination. We propose to (1) start with expertly labeled
                 data, (2) amplify labels through web applications that engage
                 citizen scientists, and (3) train machine learning on
                 amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this,
                 we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic
                 resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by
                 citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep
                 learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality,
                 based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as
                 well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC =
                 0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can
                 generalize and scale expert decision making; this is
                 particularly important in disciplines where specialized,

  abstract  = {A common approach to medical image analysis on volumetric data
               uses deep 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This is
               largely attributed to the challenges imposed by the nature of
               the 3D data: variable volume size, GPU exhaustion during
               optimization. However, dealing with the individual slices
               independently in 2D CNNs deliberately discards the depth
               information which results in poor performance for the intended
               task. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that not
               only overcome the heavy memory and computation requirements but
               also leverage the 3D information. To this end, we evaluate a set
               of volume uniformizing methods to address the aforementioned
               issues. The first method involves sampling information evenly
               from a subset of the volume. Another method exploits the full
               geometry of the 3D volume by interpolating over the z-axis. We
               demonstrate performance improvements using controlled ablation
               studies as well as put this approach to the test on the
               ImageCLEF Tuberculosis Severity Assessment 2019 benchmark. We
               report 73\% area under curve (AUC) and binary classification
               accuracy (ACC) of 67.5\% on the test set beating all methods
               which leveraged only image information (without using clinical
               meta-data) achieving 5-th position overall. All codes and models

  abstract = {Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a
              method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts)
              in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an
              important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
              disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically
              along each tract for several reasons: different populations of
              axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local
              positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding
              diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may
              reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and
              disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We
              demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in
              the brains of typically developing children and children at risk
              for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First,
              fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a
              tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects.
              Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean
              diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at
              specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along
              the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare
              white matter properties of individual patients to standardized
              Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique
              features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract
              Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white
              matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the
              preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA
              measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left
              superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the
              correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We
              introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract
              quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI
              parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation,
              AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical
              management and decision-making.},

                 differential tractography, a new type of tractography that
                 utilizes repeat MRI scans and a novel tracking strategy to map
                 the exact segment of fiber pathways with a neuronal injury. We
                 examined differential tractography on multiple sclerosis,

                 epileptic patients. The results showed that the affected
                 pathways shown by differential tractography matched well with
                 the unique clinical symptoms of the patients, and the false
                 discovery rate of the findings could be estimated using a sham

  abstract    = {Many research designs require the assessment of inter-rater
                 reliability (IRR) to demonstrate consistency among
                 observational ratings provided by multiple coders. However,
                 many studies use incorrect statistical procedures, fail to
                 fully report the information necessary to interpret their
                 results, or do not address how IRR affects the power of their
                 subsequent analyses for hypothesis testing. This paper
                 provides an overview of methodological issues related to the
                 assessment of IRR with a focus on study design, selection of
                 appropriate statistics, and the computation, interpretation,
                 and reporting of some commonly-used IRR statistics.
                 Computational examples include SPSS and R syntax for computing
                 Cohen's kappa and intra-class correlations to assess IRR.},

                 Preliminary analyses based on a finalized set of acquisition

                 modalities together in a common automated preprocessing
                 framework across a large cohort of subjects. The MRI data
                 acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on
                 conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly
                 developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal
                 preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and
                 diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish
                 many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion
                 removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and
                 alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially
                 designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the
                 HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently
                 introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate

                 temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image
                 acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing
                 pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested
                 in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these
                 pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future

  abstract    = {BACKGROUND: As greater numbers of us are living longer, it is
                 increasingly important to understand how we can age healthily.
                 Although old age is often stereotyped as a time of declining
                 mental abilities and inflexibility, cognitive neuroscience
                 reveals that older adults use neural and cognitive resources
                 flexibly, recruiting novel neural regions and cognitive
                 processes when necessary. Our aim in this project is to
                 understand how age-related changes to neural structure and
                 function interact to support cognitive abilities across the
                 lifespan. METHODS/DESIGN: We are recruiting a population-based
                 cohort of 3000 adults aged 18 and over into Stage 1 of the
                 project, where they complete an interview including health and
                 lifestyle questions, a core cognitive assessment, and a
                 self-completed questionnaire of lifetime experiences and
                 physical activity. Of those interviewed, 700 participants aged
                 18-87 (100 per age decile) continue to Stage 2 where they
                 undergo cognitive testing and provide measures of brain
                 structure and function. Cognition is assessed across multiple
                 domains including attention and executive control, language,
                 memory, emotion, action control and learning. A subset of 280
                 adults return for in-depth neurocognitive assessment in Stage
                 3, using functional neuroimaging experiments across our key
                 cognitive domains.Formal statistical models will be used to
                 examine the changes that occur with healthy ageing, and to
                 evaluate age-related reorganisation in terms of cognitive and
                 neural functions invoked to compensate for overall age-related
                 brain structural decline. Taken together the three stages
                 provide deep phenotyping that will allow us to measure neural
                 activity and flexibility during performance across a number of
                 core cognitive functions. This approach offers
                 hypothesis-driven insights into the relationship between brain
                 and behaviour in healthy ageing that are relevant to the
                 general population. DISCUSSION: Our study is a unique resource
                 of neuroimaging and cognitive measures relevant to change
                 across the adult lifespan. Because we focus on normal
                 age-related changes, our results may contribute to changing
                 views about the ageing process, lead to targeted
                 interventions, and reveal how normal ageing relates to frail
                 ageing in clinicopathological conditions such as Alzheimer's
                 disease.},

  abstract    = {Medical imaging has enormous potential for early disease
                 prediction, but is impeded by the difficulty and expense of
                 acquiring data sets before symptom onset. UK Biobank aims to
                 address this problem directly by acquiring high-quality,
                 consistently acquired imaging data from 100,000 predominantly
                 healthy participants, with health outcomes being tracked over
                 the coming decades. The brain imaging includes structural,
                 diffusion and functional modalities. Along with body and
                 cardiac imaging, genetics, lifestyle measures, biological
                 phenotyping and health records, this imaging is expected to
                 enable discovery of imaging markers of a broad range of
                 diseases at their earliest stages, as well as provide unique
                 insight into disease mechanisms. We describe UK Biobank brain
                 imaging and present results derived from the first 5,000
                 participants' data release. Although this covers just 5\% of
                 the ultimate cohort, it has already yielded a rich range of
                 associations between brain imaging and other measures
                 collected by UK Biobank.},

  abstract     = {Most psychiatric disorders are chronic, associated with high levels of disability and distress, and present during pediatric development. Scientific innovation increasingly allows researchers to probe brain-behavior relationships in the developing human. As a result, ambitions to (1) establish normative pediatric brain development trajectories akin to growth curves, (2) characterize reliable metrics for distinguishing illness, and (3) develop clinically useful tools to assist in the diagnosis and management of mental health and learning disorders have gained significant momentum. To this end, the NKI-Rockland Sample initiative was created to probe lifespan development as a large-scale multimodal dataset. The NKI-Rockland Sample Longitudinal Discovery of Brain Development Trajectories sub-study (N=369) is a 24- to 30-month multi-cohort longitudinal pediatric investigation (ages 6.0-17.0 at enrollment) carried out in a community-ascertained sample. Data include psychiatric diagnostic, medical, behavioral, and cognitive phenotyping, as well as multimodal brain imaging (resting fMRI, diffusion MRI, morphometric MRI, arterial spin labeling), genetics, and actigraphy. Herein, we present the rationale, design, and implementation of the Longitudinal Discovery of Brain Development Trajectories protocol.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe Longitudinal Discovery of Brain Development Trajectories was principally supported by NIH U01MH099059 (PI Milham). A subset of participants had baseline characterizations from the core enhanced NKI-RS protocol NIMH BRAINS R01MH094639-01 (PI Milham). Additional support was provided by NIH R01MH101555 (PI Craddock), NIH R01AG047596 (MPIs Milham and Colcombe), and the Child Mind Institute (1FDN2012-1). Funding for key personnel also provided in part by the New York State Office of Mental Health and Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study was approved by the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research Institutional Review Board.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract  = {We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental axioms—Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.}

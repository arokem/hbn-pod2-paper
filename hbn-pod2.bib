  abstract    = {With the proliferation of multi-site neuroimaging studies,
                 there is a greater need for handling non-biological variance
                 introduced by differences in MRI scanners and acquisition
                 protocols. Such unwanted sources of variation, which we refer
                 to as ``scanner effects'', can hinder the detection of imaging
                 features associated with clinical covariates of interest and
                 cause spurious findings. In this paper, we investigate scanner
                 effects in two large multi-site studies on cortical thickness
                 measurements across a total of 11 scanners. We propose a set
                 of tools for visualizing and identifying scanner effects that
                 are generalizable to other modalities. We then propose to use
                 ComBat, a technique adopted from the genomics literature and
                 recently applied to diffusion tensor imaging data, to combine
                 and harmonize cortical thickness values across scanners. We
                 show that ComBat removes unwanted sources of scan variability
                 while simultaneously increasing the power and reproducibility
                 of subsequent statistical analyses. We also show that ComBat
                 is useful for combining imaging data with the goal of studying
                 life-span trajectories in the brain.},

  abstract    = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic
                 resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying
                 microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many
                 other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical
                 between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images
                 across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional
                 anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy
                 participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that
                 the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting
                 the need of correcting for site effects before performing
                 downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that
                 combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization,
                 may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the
                 inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization
                 approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular
                 batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best
                 at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability
                 in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of
                 interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological
                 variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by
                 site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods
                 in the presence of different levels of confounding between
                 site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample
                 size studies.},

  abstract = {Advancements in technology over the last two decades have changed
              how spatial data are created and used. In particular, in the last
              decade, volunteered geographic information (VGI), i.e., the
              crowdsourcing of geographic information, has revolutionized the
              spatial domain by shifting the map-making process from the hands
              of experts to those of any willing contributor. Started in 2004,
              OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the pinnacle of VGI due to the large
              number of volunteers involved and the volume of spatial data
              generated. While the original objective of OSM was to create a
              free map of the world, its uses have shown how the potential of
              such an initiative goes well beyond map-making: ranging from
              projects such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT) project,
              that understands itself as a bridge between the OSM community and
              humanitarian responders, to collaborative projects such as
              Mapillary, where citizens take street-level images and the system
              aims to automate mapping. A common trend among these projects
              using OSM is the fact that the community dynamic tends to create
              spin-off projects. Currently, we see a drive towards projects
              that support sustainability goals using OSM. We discuss some such
              applications and highlight challenges posed by this new paradigm.
              We also explore the most promising future uses of this
              increasingly popular participatory phenomenon.},

                 Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert

  abstract    = {Obtaining reliable data and drawing meaningful and robust
                 inferences from diffusion MRI can be challenging and is
                 subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion
                 indices and eventually comparing them between groups of
                 subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts
                 at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long
                 pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is
                 susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the
                 accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors.
                 This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the
                 analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are
                 grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the
                 tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4
                 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally
                 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region
                 of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based
                 analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion
                 MRI analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and
                 eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of
                 interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We
                 have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported)
                 into a single article, which should serve as a useful
                 reference for those embarking on new diffusion MRI-based
                 studies, and as a check for those who may already be running
                 studies but may have overlooked some important confounds.
                 While some of these problems are well known to diffusion
                 experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to
                 undertake a clinical study based on diffusion MRI.},

                 and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the
                 non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is
                 routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there
                 has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and

                 quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic
                 tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible
                 for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian
                 behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this
                 method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such
                 as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an
                 extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that
                 requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified
                 image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion
                 coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess
                 kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability
                 distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure
                 from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult
                 subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be
                 significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter,
                 reflecting the structural differences between these two types
                 of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related
                 to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of
                 imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing
                 effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure
                 abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

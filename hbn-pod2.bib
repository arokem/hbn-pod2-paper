  abstract    = {We describe the Open Diffusion Data Derivatives (O3D)
                 repository: an integrated collection of preserved brain data
                 derivatives and processing pipelines, published together using
                 a single digital-object-identifier. The data derivatives were
                 generated using modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
                 imaging data (dMRI) with diverse properties of resolution and
                 signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to the data, we publish all
                 processing pipelines (also referred to as open cloud
                 services). The pipelines utilize modern methods for
                 neuroimaging data processing (diffusion-signal modelling,
                 fiber tracking, tractography evaluation, white matter
                 segmentation, and structural connectome construction). The O3D
                 open services can allow cognitive and clinical neuroscientists
                 to run the connectome mapping algorithms on new,
                 user-uploaded, data. Open source code implementing all O3D
                 services is also provided to allow computational and computer
                 scientists to reuse and extend the processing methods.
                 Publishing both data-derivatives and integrated processing
                 pipeline promotes practices for scientific reproducibility and
                 data upcycling by providing open access to the research assets

  abstract = {Advancements in technology over the last two decades have changed
              how spatial data are created and used. In particular, in the last
              decade, volunteered geographic information (VGI), i.e., the
              crowdsourcing of geographic information, has revolutionized the
              spatial domain by shifting the map-making process from the hands
              of experts to those of any willing contributor. Started in 2004,
              OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the pinnacle of VGI due to the large
              number of volunteers involved and the volume of spatial data
              generated. While the original objective of OSM was to create a
              free map of the world, its uses have shown how the potential of
              such an initiative goes well beyond map-making: ranging from
              projects such as the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap (HOT) project,
              that understands itself as a bridge between the OSM community and
              humanitarian responders, to collaborative projects such as
              Mapillary, where citizens take street-level images and the system
              aims to automate mapping. A common trend among these projects
              using OSM is the fact that the community dynamic tends to create
              spin-off projects. Currently, we see a drive towards projects
              that support sustainability goals using OSM. We discuss some such
              applications and highlight challenges posed by this new paradigm.
              We also explore the most promising future uses of this
              increasingly popular participatory phenomenon.},

  abstract    = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established magnetic
                 resonance imaging (MRI) technique used for studying
                 microstructural changes in the white matter. As with many
                 other imaging modalities, DTI images suffer from technical
                 between-scanner variation that hinders comparisons of images
                 across imaging sites, scanners and over time. Using fractional
                 anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps of 205 healthy
                 participants acquired on two different scanners, we show that
                 the DTI measurements are highly site-specific, highlighting
                 the need of correcting for site effects before performing
                 downstream statistical analyses. We first show evidence that
                 combining DTI data from multiple sites, without harmonization,
                 may be counter-productive and negatively impacts the
                 inference. Then, we propose and compare several harmonization
                 approaches for DTI data, and show that ComBat, a popular
                 batch-effect correction tool used in genomics, performs best
                 at modeling and removing the unwanted inter-site variability
                 in FA and MD maps. Using age as a biological phenotype of
                 interest, we show that ComBat both preserves biological
                 variability and removes the unwanted variation introduced by
                 site. Finally, we assess the different harmonization methods
                 in the presence of different levels of confounding between
                 site and age, in addition to test robustness to small sample
                 size studies.},

  abstract    = {With the proliferation of multi-site neuroimaging studies,
                 there is a greater need for handling non-biological variance
                 introduced by differences in MRI scanners and acquisition
                 protocols. Such unwanted sources of variation, which we refer
                 to as ``scanner effects'', can hinder the detection of imaging
                 features associated with clinical covariates of interest and
                 cause spurious findings. In this paper, we investigate scanner
                 effects in two large multi-site studies on cortical thickness
                 measurements across a total of 11 scanners. We propose a set
                 of tools for visualizing and identifying scanner effects that
                 are generalizable to other modalities. We then propose to use
                 ComBat, a technique adopted from the genomics literature and
                 recently applied to diffusion tensor imaging data, to combine
                 and harmonize cortical thickness values across scanners. We
                 show that ComBat removes unwanted sources of scan variability
                 while simultaneously increasing the power and reproducibility
                 of subsequent statistical analyses. We also show that ComBat
                 is useful for combining imaging data with the goal of studying
                 life-span trajectories in the brain.},

  abstract    = {The development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
                 has defined modern neuroimaging. Since its inception, tens of
                 thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI
                 and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the
                 non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is
                 routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there
                 has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and
                 describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This
                 renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs)
                 difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the
                 application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance
                 protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain
                 Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and
                 describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses file formats
                 compatible with existing software, unifies the majority of
                 practices already common in the field, and captures the
                 metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.},

                 quantifying the degree to which water diffusion in biologic
                 tissues is non-Gaussian. Since tissue structure is responsible
                 for the deviation of water diffusion from the Gaussian
                 behavior typically observed in homogeneous solutions, this
                 method provides a specific measure of tissue structure, such
                 as cellular compartments and membranes. The method is an
                 extension of conventional diffusion-weighted imaging that
                 requires the use of somewhat higher b values and a modified
                 image postprocessing procedure. In addition to the diffusion
                 coefficient, the method provides an estimate for the excess
                 kurtosis of the diffusion displacement probability
                 distribution, which is a dimensionless metric of the departure
                 from a Gaussian form. From the study of six healthy adult
                 subjects, the excess diffusional kurtosis is found to be
                 significantly higher in white matter than in gray matter,
                 reflecting the structural differences between these two types
                 of cerebral tissues. Diffusional kurtosis imaging is related
                 to q-space imaging methods, but is less demanding in terms of
                 imaging time, hardware requirements, and postprocessing
                 effort. It may be useful for assessing tissue structure
                 abnormalities associated with a variety of neuropathologies.},

                 inferences from diffusion MRI can be challenging and is
                 subject to many pitfalls. The process of quantifying diffusion
                 indices and eventually comparing them between groups of
                 subjects and/or correlating them with other parameters starts
                 at the acquisition of the raw data, followed by a long
                 pipeline of image processing steps. Each one of these steps is
                 susceptible to sources of bias, which may not only limit the
                 accuracy and precision, but can lead to substantial errors.
                 This article provides a detailed review of the steps along the
                 analysis pipeline and their associated pitfalls. These are
                 grouped into 1 pre-processing of data; 2 estimation of the
                 tensor; 3 derivation of voxelwise quantitative parameters; 4
                 strategies for extracting quantitative parameters; and finally
                 5 intra-subject and inter-subject comparison, including region
                 of interest, histogram, tract-specific and voxel-based
                 analyses. The article covers important aspects of diffusion
                 MRI analysis, such as motion correction, susceptibility and
                 eddy current distortion correction, model fitting, region of
                 interest placement, histogram and voxel-based analysis. We
                 have assembled 25 pitfalls (several previously unreported)
                 into a single article, which should serve as a useful
                 reference for those embarking on new diffusion MRI-based
                 studies, and as a check for those who may already be running
                 studies but may have overlooked some important confounds.
                 While some of these problems are well known to diffusion
                 experts, they might not be to other researchers wishing to
                 undertake a clinical study based on diffusion MRI.},

  abstract    = {Tissue classification plays a crucial role in the
                 investigation of normal neural development, brain-behavior
                 relationships, and the disease mechanisms of many psychiatric
                 and neurological illnesses. Ensuring the accuracy of tissue
                 classification is important for quality research and, in
                 particular, the translation of imaging biomarkers to clinical
                 practice. Assessment with the human eye is vital to correct
                 various errors inherent to all currently available
                 segmentation algorithms. Manual quality assurance becomes
                 methodologically difficult at a large scale - a problem of
                 increasing importance as the number of data sets is on the
                 rise. To make this process more efficient, we have developed
                 Mindcontrol, an open-source web application for the
                 collaborative quality control of neuroimaging processing
                 outputs. The Mindcontrol platform consists of a dashboard to
                 organize data, descriptive visualizations to explore the data,
                 an imaging viewer, and an in-browser annotation and editing
                 toolbox for data curation and quality control. Mindcontrol is
                 flexible and can be configured for the outputs of any software
                 package in any data organization structure. Example
                 configurations for three large, open-source datasets are
                 presented: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP), the
                 Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR), and the
                 Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) Collection. These
                 demo applications link descriptive quality control metrics,
                 regional brain volumes, and thickness scalars to a 3D imaging
                 viewer and editing module, resulting in an easy-to-implement
                 quality control protocol that can be scaled for any size and

                 discovery. However, many standard lab protocols rely on manual
                 examination, which is not feasible for large-scale datasets.
                 Meanwhile, automated approaches lack the accuracy of expert
                 examination. We propose to (1) start with expertly labeled
                 data, (2) amplify labels through web applications that engage
                 citizen scientists, and (3) train machine learning on
                 amplified labels, to emulate the experts. Demonstrating this,
                 we developed a system to quality control brain magnetic
                 resonance images. Expert-labeled data were amplified by
                 citizen scientists through a simple web interface. A deep
                 learning algorithm was then trained to predict data quality,
                 based on citizen scientist labels. Deep learning performed as
                 well as specialized algorithms for quality control (AUC =
                 0.99). Combining citizen science and deep learning can
                 generalize and scale expert decision making; this is
                 particularly important in disciplines where specialized,

  abstract  = {A common approach to medical image analysis on volumetric data
               uses deep 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This is
               largely attributed to the challenges imposed by the nature of
               the 3D data: variable volume size, GPU exhaustion during
               optimization. However, dealing with the individual slices
               independently in 2D CNNs deliberately discards the depth
               information which results in poor performance for the intended
               task. Therefore, it is important to develop methods that not
               only overcome the heavy memory and computation requirements but
               also leverage the 3D information. To this end, we evaluate a set
               of volume uniformizing methods to address the aforementioned
               issues. The first method involves sampling information evenly
               from a subset of the volume. Another method exploits the full
               geometry of the 3D volume by interpolating over the z-axis. We
               demonstrate performance improvements using controlled ablation
               studies as well as put this approach to the test on the
               ImageCLEF Tuberculosis Severity Assessment 2019 benchmark. We
               report 73\% area under curve (AUC) and binary classification
               accuracy (ACC) of 67.5\% on the test set beating all methods
               which leveraged only image information (without using clinical
               meta-data) achieving 5-th position overall. All codes and models
               are made available at
               https://github.com/hasibzunair/uniformizing-3D.},
